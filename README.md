# app-approval
A repository to track the approval status of apps on apps.owncloud.com 

If you have developed an app and want it to get reviewed and approved for inclusion in the ownCloud app store, read the [publishing documentation with requirements here](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/9.0/developer_manual/app/publishing.html) (update version number in the link to the latest!) and then create an issue in this repository, filling in the details in the following template:

# Template
* App name
* new/update: is this the first review for approval or a release or a previously approved app
devURL: 
* StoreURL: URL of your app in the ownCloud app store on apps.owncloud.com
* Repo: URL of your app in github or another source code tracker
* authors: @mentions or name + email addresses of at least core (regular) contributors/developers
* comments: Please note how you applied the app guidelines and share your thoughts on why the app would be a great addition for the ownCloud ecosystem.

Please put app name and new or update in the title of the github issue.

# Help review
Once you created your issue, please take some time to review 2 to 4 submissions by other app authors to see if they fullfill the guidelines. As each app needs review by at least two people, reviewing some apps will ensure your approval request gets proper attention. Please mention your app with a # on the reviews you do/did so it is easy to see who reviewed what.

Some social guidelines for reviewing:
* **Please be kind to others**. Not everybody is a rockstar coder but that does not mean their app is not valuable.
* **Be honest**. If you think something can be done better, say so. It helps others learn and many of us consider learning new things fun! This does not contradict the first point: you can tell people what you think can be improved without being rude.
* **Allow differences of opinion**. Code is art. And like with any art, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Some things are technically good or bad, but other things (indentation, anyone?) are merely a matter of taste. Don't get upset about them.
* **Accept emotions**. We LOVE what we do. That can create strong feelings. Sometimes people are tired or distracted and get upset. A single outburst should not disqualify anybody - give people the benefit of the doubt and give them a chance to explain and apologize. Vice-versa, be strong enough to apologize yourself if need be.

Remember: *Kindness shows strenght. Rudeness shows lack of interest and confidence.*
